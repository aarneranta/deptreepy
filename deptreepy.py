usage:

   python3 deptreepy.py <command> <arg>*

The command-arg combinations are

   match_wordlines '<pattern>'
   match_subtrees '<pattern>'

They read CoNLL-U content from std-in, for example, with '<eng-ud.conlluÂ¨

The following patterns match both wordlines and trees, depending on the command:

   FORM  <strpatt>
   LEMMA <strpatt>
   POS   <strpatt>
   FEATS <strpatt>
   DEPREL <strpatt>
   HEAD_DISTANCE <inpred>
   AND <pattern>*
   OR  <pattern>*
   NOT <pattern>*

When applied to trees, they match the root node of the tree.
The following patterns match only trees:

   LENGTH <intpred>
   DEPTH <intpred>
   TREE <pattern> <pattern>*
   HAS_SUBTREE <pattern>*

The auxialiary concepts are:

   <strpatt>, a string with *,?,[seq] wildcards (like Unix filenames)
   <intpred>, one of =n, <n, >n, !n, giving a comparison to number n (which can be negative)

For example,

   TREE (AND) (HEAD_DISTANCE >0) (HEAD_DISTANCE <0)

matches trees that have both a head-final and a head-initial constituent: `(AND)` is true
of the head, because it poses no conditions on it, the first subtree comes before the head
(has a positive distance to it) and the second one after the head (negative distance).

   FEATS *=In*

matches indicative, infinitive, inessive, and other features starting with "In".

Quotes are not used outside string patterns: if used, they can only match strings with
actual quotes.
